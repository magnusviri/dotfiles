# mysetup
Scripts to setup my new computers. I go through new computers so often (and VM's too) I'm really tired of doing it over and over. I've been meaning to do this forever. It's finally time.

This is exclusively for James' use. If you want to configure your computers the way James likes, then by all means run this on your computers.

Be sure to do this.
