# mysetup
Scripts to setup my new computers. I go through new computers so often (and VM's too) I'm really tired of doing it over and over. I've been meaning to do this forever. It's finally time.

This is exclusively for James' use. If you want to configure your computers the way James likes, then by all means run this on your computers.

Be sure to do this.

## Mac

  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magnusviri/mysetup/master/mac.sh)"

## Linux

  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magnusviri/mysetup/master/linux.sh)"

## Windows

Hahahahaha! ;)

No seriously, when I actually have something to configure I'll add something I'm sure. I better hurry up and start using Windows so I can get to it.
