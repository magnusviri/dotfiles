# mysetup
Scripts to setup my new computers. I go through new computers so often (and VM's too) I'm really tired of doing it over and over. I've been meaning to do this forever. It's finally time.

Be sure to do this.

## Install/Update

  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magnusviri/dotfiles/master/.dotfiles/install-new-computer.sh)"

I'm still not sure if I want to run `git clone https://github.com/magnusviri/dotfiles.git` and move it to my ~/. I'm going to try it on a VM and see how it goes.
